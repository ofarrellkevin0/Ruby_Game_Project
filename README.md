# Ruby_Game_Project
A small game I'm currently developing using Ruby.
This game was developed for the purposes of understanding the ruby language itself.
This game is a console application game and the user need only type in numbers to play the game properly.
There are steps that are well laid out to ensure that the user understands how the game works.
